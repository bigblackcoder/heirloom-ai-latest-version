# Heirloom Mobile Implementation Guide

This document provides instructions for implementing the Heirloom Identity Platform on mobile devices using React Native.

## Overview

The Heirloom Identity Platform provides a comprehensive identity verification system with facial recognition capabilities. This implementation guide focuses on the mobile-specific aspects of the platform.

## Prerequisites

- React Native development environment
- Node.js v18+ and npm/yarn
- iOS development tools (for iOS builds): Xcode 14+
- Android development tools (for Android builds): Android Studio with SDK 33+

## Project Structure

The mobile application shares core logic with the web version but includes platform-specific implementations for:

- Camera access and face detection
- Native UI components
- Platform-specific navigation

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the package.mobile.json file
2. Install pods for iOS
3. Run the application for iOS or Android

## Face Verification Implementation

The mobile implementation uses a combination of on-device face detection and server verification:

1. Client-side face detection uses the device camera to:
   - Detect face position and alignment
   - Ensure proper lighting conditions
   - Capture high-quality frames for verification

2. Server-side verification:
   - Processes captured frames
   - Performs identity verification
   - Manages identity storage

## UI/UX Considerations

The mobile implementation follows iOS-like design patterns:

- Sliding modals for verification flows
- Native bottom sheets for additional actions
- Full-screen camera interfaces with clear user guidance
- Haptic feedback for successful verification

## Platform-Specific Features

### iOS-Specific

- Uses AVFoundation for camera access
- Implements native sharing capabilities
- Supports Face ID integration

### Android-Specific

- Uses Camera2 API for camera access
- Implements Material Design components
- Supports Biometric API integration

## Performance Optimization

Mobile implementation includes:

- Efficient frame processing to minimize battery usage
- Optimized network requests for verification
- Client-side caching for improved performance

## Security Considerations

- All verification data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Biometric data never leaves the device unencrypted
- Session management follows OAuth 2.0 best practices

## Deployment

Prepare for store deployment by:

1. Configuring app signing
2. Setting proper permissions in app manifests
3. Creating app store listings with appropriate screenshots
4. Completing privacy policy documentation
