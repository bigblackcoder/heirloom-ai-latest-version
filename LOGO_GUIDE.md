# How to Add Your Logo Files

## Step 1: Prepare Your Logo Files
- Ensure you have these three logo files ready:
  - `heirloom-icon.png` - The small circular icon logo (the green circle with down arrow)
  - `heirloom-full.png` - The full logo with emblem
  - `heirloom-complete.png` - The complete logo with text

## Step 2: Add Files to the Project
1. Navigate to the `public/images` folder in the Replit file explorer
2. Upload your logo files by dragging and dropping them into this folder
3. Make sure the filenames match exactly what's listed above

## Step 3: Verify the Implementation
The logo component is configured to automatically use these files from the following locations:
- `/images/heirloom-icon.png`
- `/images/heirloom-full.png`
- `/images/heirloom-complete.png`

No code changes are needed as long as you use these exact filenames.

## Additional Information
- The logo files should be properly sized and optimized for web use
- PNG format with transparency is recommended
- The circular icon logo should be a perfect circle
- For the icon logo, aim for dimensions around 100x100 pixels
