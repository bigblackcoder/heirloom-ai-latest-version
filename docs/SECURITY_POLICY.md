# Security Policy for Heirloom Identity Platform

## Credential Management

### Never Hard-code Credentials
- **Do not** embed API keys, passwords, or credentials in:
  - Source code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.)
  - Configuration files
  - SVG or image files (via embedded metadata)
  - HTML or CSS files
  - JSON or YAML files

### Best Practices for Credential Management
1. **Always use environment variables** for sensitive information
   ```typescript
   // Good practice
   const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
   
   // Bad practice - never do this
   const apiKey = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE";
   ```

2. **Use Replit's secrets management**
   - Store credentials securely in Replit's secrets/environment variables
   - Access them via process.env in your code

3. **Rotate credentials** regularly
   - Change passwords and API keys every 90 days
   - Immediately rotate any credentials that may have been exposed

4. **Use server-side operations** for sensitive API calls
   - Never expose credentials to the client side
   - Make sensitive API calls from your server code only

## File and Image Handling

1. **Process images server-side** before storage
   - Strip metadata from uploaded images
   - Regenerate SVGs if necessary to remove embedded data

2. **Use the provided storage utilities**
   - Use server/utils/replit-storage.ts for file operations
   - This ensures files are stored securely without exposing credentials

3. **Implement proper access controls**
   - Verify user permissions before allowing access to files
   - Use signed URLs for temporary access when needed

## API Security

1. **Use the secure API utilities**
   - Leverage server/utils/secure-api.ts for all external API calls
   - This ensures credentials are properly handled

2. **Implement proper error handling**
   - Never expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log errors securely without including credentials

## Regular Security Reviews

1. **Conduct code reviews** with security in mind
   - Check for hardcoded credentials
   - Ensure proper use of environment variables

2. **Run credential scanning tools** regularly
   - Use tools like gitleaks to detect credential leaks
   - Address any findings immediately

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. Do not disclose it publicly
2. Document the issue with details
3. Report it to the security team immediately
4. Do not commit any changes that include the vulnerability
