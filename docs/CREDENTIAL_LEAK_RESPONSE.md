# Credential Leak Response Plan

This document outlines the steps to take if credentials are accidentally leaked in the codebase, particularly in relation to AWS access tokens or other sensitive information.

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Invalidate/Rotate the Compromised Credentials

#### For AWS Credentials:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to IAM > Users > [affected user]
3. Select the "Security credentials" tab
4. Find the compromised access key and click "Delete"
5. Create a new access key if needed
6. Update environment variables with the new key

#### For Other API Keys or Tokens:

1. Log in to the respective service's management portal
2. Find the section for API keys or tokens
3. Revoke/delete the compromised token
4. Generate a new token
5. Update environment variables with the new token

### 2. Assess the Exposure

Determine the scope and potential impact of the leak:

1. When was the credential first leaked?
2. How long has it been exposed?
3. Who might have had access to it?
4. What resources could be accessed with these credentials?
5. Are there any signs of unauthorized access or usage?

### 3. Review Access Logs

Check for any suspicious activity:

1. For AWS, review CloudTrail logs for the timeframe the credentials were exposed
2. Look for unexpected API calls, resource creations, or data access patterns
3. Note any IP addresses that aren't associated with known team members or services

## Follow-up Actions

### 1. Update Environment Variables

1. Make sure all instances of the application are using the new credentials
2. Check CI/CD pipelines and development environments
3. Verify that no hard-coded credentials remain in the codebase

### 2. Run a Thorough Scan

Use our enhanced scanning tools to ensure no other credentials are leaked:

```bash
./scripts/scan-credentials.sh
```

### 3. Document the Incident

Create a confidential post-mortem document that includes:

1. Timeline of events
2. What credentials were exposed and for how long
3. Actions taken to mitigate the issue
4. Findings from the security investigation
5. Recommendations to prevent future occurrences

### 4. Implement Preventive Measures

1. Ensure the git pre-commit hook is enabled for all developers
2. Review and enhance security training for team members
3. Consider implementing additional automated scanning tools
4. For AWS specifically, consider using IAM roles instead of access keys where possible

## Preventive Guidelines

### Secure Credential Management

1. Always use environment variables for credentials
2. Never commit `.env` files to the repository
3. Use a secure method for sharing credentials with team members (password manager, etc.)
4. Regularly rotate credentials even if there hasn't been a leak

### Image and SVG Best Practices

1. Never embed credentials in screenshots or images
2. Avoid using base64-encoded data in SVG files
3. Always scan SVG files before committing them
4. Refer to [Secure SVG Creation Guide](./SECURE_SVG_GUIDE.md)
