# Sound Effects Directory

This directory contains sound effects for the Heirloom application.

## Files

- `success.mp3`: Plays when a verification is successful
- `complete.mp3`: Plays when a process is completed
- `transition.mp3`: Plays when transitioning between sections
- `welcome.mp3`: Plays when the application starts

These sound files should be subtle and non-intrusive to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
