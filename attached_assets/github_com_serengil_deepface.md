It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping **state-of-the-art** models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/), [`FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/), [`DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/), [`DeepID`](https://sefiks.com/2020/06/16/face-recognition-with-deepid-in-keras/), [`ArcFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), `SFace`, `GhostFaceNet`, `Buffalo_L`.

[`Experiments`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) show that **human beings have 97.53% accuracy** on facial recognition tasks whereas those models already reached and passed that accuracy level.

**A Modern Facial Recognition Pipeline** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/WnUVYQP4h44)

A modern [**face recognition pipeline**](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-face-recognition-in-deep-learning/) consists of 5 common stages: [detect](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/25/deep-face-detection-with-opencv-in-python/), [align](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [normalize](https://sefiks.com/2020/11/20/facial-landmarks-for-face-recognition-with-dlib/), [represent](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) and [verify](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/22/fine-tuning-the-threshold-in-face-recognition/). While DeepFace handles all these common stages in the background, you don’t need to acquire in-depth knowledge about all the processes behind it. You can just call its verification, find or analysis function with a single line of code.

**Face Verification** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/KRCvkNCOphE)

This function verifies face pairs as same person or different persons. It expects exact image paths as inputs. Passing numpy or base64 encoded images is also welcome. Then, it is going to return a dictionary and you should check just its verified key.

```
result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg",
  img2_path = "img2.jpg",
)
```

**Face recognition** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/Hrjp-EStM_s)

[Face recognition](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/25/large-scale-face-recognition-for-deep-learning/) requires applying face verification many times. Herein, deepface has an out-of-the-box find function to handle this action. It's going to look for the identity of input image in the database path and it will return list of pandas data frame as output. Meanwhile, facial embeddings of the facial database are stored in a pickle file to be searched faster in next time. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the source image. Besides, target images in the database can have many faces as well.

```
dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg",
  db_path = "C:/workspace/my_db",
)
```

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-6-v2.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-6-v2.jpg)

**Embeddings** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/OYialFo7Qo4)

Face recognition models basically represent facial images as multi-dimensional vectors. Sometimes, you need those embedding vectors directly. DeepFace comes with a dedicated representation function. Represent function returns a list of embeddings. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the image path.

```
embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg"
)
```

This function returns an array as embedding. The size of the embedding array would be different based on the model name. For instance, VGG-Face is the default model and it represents facial images as 4096 dimensional vectors.

```
for embedding_obj in embedding_objs:
  embedding = embedding_obj["embedding"]
  assert isinstance(embedding, list)
  assert (
    model_name == "VGG-Face"
    and len(embedding) == 4096
  )
```

Here, embedding is also [plotted](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-face-recognition-in-deep-learning/) with 4096 slots horizontally. Each slot is corresponding to a dimension value in the embedding vector and dimension value is explained in the colorbar on the right. Similar to 2D barcodes, vertical dimension stores no information in the illustration.

**Face recognition models** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/eKOZawGR3y0)

DeepFace is a **hybrid** face recognition package. It currently wraps many **state-of-the-art** face recognition models: [`VGG-Face`](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/06/deep-face-recognition-with-keras/) , [`FaceNet`](https://sefiks.com/2018/09/03/face-recognition-with-facenet-in-keras/), [`OpenFace`](https://sefiks.com/2019/07/21/face-recognition-with-openface-in-keras/), [`DeepFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/17/face-recognition-with-facebook-deepface-in-keras/), [`DeepID`](https://sefiks.com/2020/06/16/face-recognition-with-deepid-in-keras/), [`ArcFace`](https://sefiks.com/2020/12/14/deep-face-recognition-with-arcface-in-keras-and-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), `SFace`, `GhostFaceNet` and `Buffalo_L`. The default configuration uses VGG-Face model.

```
models = [\
  "VGG-Face",\
  "Facenet",\
  "Facenet512",\
  "OpenFace",\
  "DeepFace",\
  "DeepID",\
  "ArcFace",\
  "Dlib",\
  "SFace",\
  "GhostFaceNet",\
  "Buffalo_L"\
]

#face verification
result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg",
  img2_path = "img2.jpg",
  model_name = models[0],
)

#face recognition
dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg",
  db_path = "C:/workspace/my_db",
  model_name = models[1],
)

#embeddings
embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg",
  model_name = models[2],
)
```

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/model-portfolio-20240316.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/model-portfolio-20240316.jpg)

FaceNet, VGG-Face, ArcFace and Dlib are overperforming ones based on experiments - see [`BENCHMARKS`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) for more details. You can find the measured scores of various models in DeepFace and the reported scores from their original studies in the following table.

| Model | Measured Score | Declared Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Facenet512 | 98.4% | 99.6% |
| Human-beings | 97.5% | 97.5% |
| Facenet | 97.4% | 99.2% |
| Dlib | 96.8% | 99.3 % |
| VGG-Face | 96.7% | 98.9% |
| ArcFace | 96.7% | 99.5% |
| GhostFaceNet | 93.3% | 99.7% |
| SFace | 93.0% | 99.5% |
| OpenFace | 78.7% | 92.9% |
| DeepFace | 69.0% | 97.3% |
| DeepID | 66.5% | 97.4% |

Conducting experiments with those models within DeepFace may reveal disparities compared to the original studies, owing to the adoption of distinct detection or normalization techniques. Furthermore, some models have been released solely with their backbones, lacking pre-trained weights. Thus, we are utilizing their re-implementations instead of the original pre-trained weights.

**Similarity** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/1EPoS69fHOc)

Face recognition models are regular [convolutional neural networks](https://sefiks.com/2018/03/23/convolutional-autoencoder-clustering-images-with-neural-networks/) and they are responsible to represent faces as vectors. We expect that a face pair of same person should be [more similar](https://sefiks.com/2020/05/22/fine-tuning-the-threshold-in-face-recognition/) than a face pair of different persons.

Similarity could be calculated by different metrics such as [Cosine Similarity](https://sefiks.com/2018/08/13/cosine-similarity-in-machine-learning/), Euclidean Distance or L2 normalized Euclidean. The default configuration uses cosine similarity. According to [experiments](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks), no distance metric is overperforming than other.

```
metrics = ["cosine", "euclidean", "euclidean_l2"]

#face verification
result = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg",
  img2_path = "img2.jpg",
  distance_metric = metrics[1],
)

#face recognition
dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img1.jpg",
  db_path = "C:/workspace/my_db",
  distance_metric = metrics[2],
)
```

**Facial Attribute Analysis** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/GT2UeN85BdA)

DeepFace also comes with a strong facial attribute analysis module including [`age`](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [`gender`](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/), [`facial expression`](https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/) (including angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise) and [`race`](https://sefiks.com/2019/11/11/race-and-ethnicity-prediction-in-keras/) (including asian, white, middle eastern, indian, latino and black) predictions. Result is going to be the size of faces appearing in the source image.

```
objs = DeepFace.analyze(
  img_path = "img4.jpg",
  actions = ['age', 'gender', 'race', 'emotion'],
)
```

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-2.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-2.jpg)

Age model got ± 4.65 MAE; gender model got 97.44% accuracy, 96.29% precision and 95.05% recall as mentioned in its [tutorial](https://sefiks.com/2019/02/13/apparent-age-and-gender-prediction-in-keras/).

**Face Detection and Alignment** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/GZ2p2hj2H5k)

Face detection and alignment are important early stages of a modern face recognition pipeline. [Experiments](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/benchmarks) show that detection increases the face recognition accuracy up to 42%, while alignment increases it up to 6%. [`OpenCV`](https://sefiks.com/2020/02/23/face-alignment-for-face-recognition-in-python-within-opencv/), [`Ssd`](https://sefiks.com/2020/08/25/deep-face-detection-with-opencv-in-python/), [`Dlib`](https://sefiks.com/2020/07/11/face-recognition-with-dlib-in-python/), [`MtCnn`](https://sefiks.com/2020/09/09/deep-face-detection-with-mtcnn-in-python/), `Faster MtCnn`, [`RetinaFace`](https://sefiks.com/2021/04/27/deep-face-detection-with-retinaface-in-python/), [`MediaPipe`](https://sefiks.com/2022/01/14/deep-face-detection-with-mediapipe/), `Yolo`, `YuNet` and `CenterFace` detectors are wrapped in deepface.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-portfolio-v6.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-portfolio-v6.jpg)

All deepface functions accept optional detector backend and align input arguments. You can switch among those detectors and alignment modes with these arguments. OpenCV is the default detector and alignment is on by default.

```
backends = [\
  'opencv',\
  'ssd',\
  'dlib',\
  'mtcnn',\
  'fastmtcnn',\
  'retinaface',\
  'mediapipe',\
  'yolov8',\
  'yolov11s',\
  'yolov11n',\
  'yolov11m',\
  'yunet',\
  'centerface',\
]

alignment_modes = [True, False]

#face verification
obj = DeepFace.verify(
  img1_path = "img1.jpg",
  img2_path = "img2.jpg",
  detector_backend = backends[0],
  align = alignment_modes[0],
)

#face recognition
dfs = DeepFace.find(
  img_path = "img.jpg",
  db_path = "my_db",
  detector_backend = backends[1],
  align = alignment_modes[0],
)

#embeddings
embedding_objs = DeepFace.represent(
  img_path = "img.jpg",
  detector_backend = backends[2],
  align = alignment_modes[0],
)

#facial analysis
demographies = DeepFace.analyze(
  img_path = "img4.jpg",
  detector_backend = backends[3],
  align = alignment_modes[0],
)

#face detection and alignment
face_objs = DeepFace.extract_faces(
  img_path = "img.jpg",
  detector_backend = backends[4],
  align = alignment_modes[0],
)
```

Face recognition models are actually CNN models and they expect standard sized inputs. So, resizing is required before representation. To avoid deformation, deepface adds black padding pixels according to the target size argument after detection and alignment.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-outputs-20240414.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/detector-outputs-20240414.jpg)

[RetinaFace](https://sefiks.com/2021/04/27/deep-face-detection-with-retinaface-in-python/) and [MtCnn](https://sefiks.com/2020/09/09/deep-face-detection-with-mtcnn-in-python/) seem to overperform in detection and alignment stages but they are much slower. If the speed of your pipeline is more important, then you should use opencv or ssd. On the other hand, if you consider the accuracy, then you should use retinaface or mtcnn.

The performance of RetinaFace is very satisfactory even in the crowd as seen in the following illustration. Besides, it comes with an incredible facial landmark detection performance. Highlighted red points show some facial landmarks such as eyes, nose and mouth. That's why, alignment score of RetinaFace is high as well.

**Real Time Analysis** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/-c9sSJcx6wI), [`React Demo part-i`](https://youtu.be/IXoah6rhxac), [`React Demo part-ii`](https://youtu.be/_waBA-cH2D4)

You can run deepface for real time videos as well. Stream function will access your webcam and apply both face recognition and facial attribute analysis. The function starts to analyze a frame if it can focus a face sequentially 5 frames. Then, it shows results 5 seconds.

```
DeepFace.stream(db_path = "C:/User/Sefik/Desktop/database")
```

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-3.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/stock-3.jpg)

Even though face recognition is based on one-shot learning, you can use multiple face pictures of a person as well. You should rearrange your directory structure as illustrated below.

```
user
├── database
│   ├── Alice
│   │   ├── Alice1.jpg
│   │   ├── Alice2.jpg
│   ├── Bob
│   │   ├── Bob.jpg
```

If you intend to perform face verification or analysis tasks directly from your browser, [`deepface-react-ui`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface-react-ui) is a separate repository built using ReactJS depending on deepface api.

**Face Anti Spoofing** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/UiK1aIjOBlQ)

DeepFace also includes an anti-spoofing analysis module to understand given image is real or fake. To activate this feature, set the `anti_spoofing` argument to True in any DeepFace tasks.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/face-anti-spoofing.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/face-anti-spoofing.jpg)

```
# anti spoofing test in face detection
face_objs = DeepFace.extract_faces(
  img_path="dataset/img1.jpg",
  anti_spoofing = True
)
assert all(face_obj["is_real"] is True for face_obj in face_objs)

# anti spoofing test in real time analysis
DeepFace.stream(
  db_path = "C:/User/Sefik/Desktop/database",
  anti_spoofing = True
)
```

**API** \- [`Demo`](https://youtu.be/HeKCQ6U9XmI), [`Docker Demo`](https://youtu.be/9Tk9lRQareA)

DeepFace serves an API as well - see [`api folder`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/deepface/api/src) for more details. You can clone deepface source code and run the api with the following command. It will use gunicorn server to get a rest service up. In this way, you can call deepface from an external system such as mobile app or web.

```
cd script

# run the service directly
./service.sh

# run the service via docker
./dockerize.sh
```

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-api.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-api.jpg)

Face recognition, facial attribute analysis and vector representation functions are covered in the API. You are expected to call these functions as http post methods. Default service endpoints will be `http://localhost:5005/verify` for face recognition, `http://localhost:5005/analyze` for facial attribute analysis, and `http://localhost:5005/represent` for vector representation. The API accepts images as file uploads (via form data), or as exact image paths, URLs, or base64-encoded strings (via either JSON or form data), providing versatile options for different client requirements. [Here](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master/deepface/api/postman), you can find a postman project to find out how these methods should be called.

**Large Scale Facial Recognition** \- [`Playlist`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsS_1RYmYQQGSJu_Z3OVhXhGmZ86_zuIm)

If your task requires facial recognition on large datasets, you should combine DeepFace with a vector index or vector database. This setup will perform [approximate nearest neighbor](https://youtu.be/c10w0Ptn_CU) searches instead of exact ones, allowing you to identify a face in a database containing billions of entries within milliseconds. Common vector index solutions include [Annoy](https://youtu.be/Jpxm914o2xk), [Faiss](https://youtu.be/6AmEvDTKT-k), [Voyager](https://youtu.be/2ZYTV9HlFdU), [NMSLIB](https://youtu.be/EVBhO8rbKbg), [ElasticSearch](https://youtu.be/i4GvuOmzKzo). For vector databases, popular options are [Postgres with its pgvector extension](https://youtu.be/Xfv4hCWvkp0) and [RediSearch](https://youtu.be/yrXlS0d6t4w).

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-big-data.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serengil/deepface/master/icon/deepface-big-data.jpg)

Conversely, if your task involves facial recognition on small to moderate-sized databases, you can adopt use relational databases such as [Postgres](https://youtu.be/f41sLxn1c0k) or [SQLite](https://youtu.be/_1ShBeWToPg), or NoSQL databases like [Mongo](https://youtu.be/dmprgum9Xu8), [Redis](https://youtu.be/X7DSpUMVTsw) or [Cassandra](https://youtu.be/J_yXpc3Y8Ec) to perform exact nearest neighbor search.

**Encrypt Embeddings** \- `Demo with PHE`, [`Demo with FHE`](https://youtu.be/njjw0PEhH00), [`Tutorial for PHE`](https://sefiks.com/2025/03/04/vector-similarity-search-with-partially-homomorphic-encryption-in-python/), [`Tutorial for FHE`](https://sefiks.com/2021/12/01/homomorphic-facial-recognition-with-tenseal/)

Even though vector embeddings are not reversible to original images, they still contain sensitive information such as fingerprints, making their security critical. Encrypting embeddings is essential for higher security applications to prevent adversarial attacks that could manipulate or extract sensitive information. Traditional encryption methods like AES are very safe but limited in securely utilizing cloud computational power for distance calculations. Herein, [homomorphic encryption](https://youtu.be/3ejI0zNPMEQ), allowing calculations on encrypted data, offers a robust alternative. In summary, we are able to compute encrypted similarity between encrypted embeddings with homomorphic encryption.

```
from lightphe import LightPHE

def on_prem():
    # build an additively homomorhic encryption cryptosystem
    onprem_cs = LightPHE(algorithm_name = "Paillier", precision = 19)

    # export keys
    onprem_cs.export_keys("secret.txt")
    onprem_cs.export_keys("public.txt", public=True)

    # find l2 normalized and all positive vector embeddings - VGG-Face already does
    source_embedding = DeepFace.represent("img1.jpg")[0]["embedding"]

    # encrypt source embedding
    encrypted_source_embedding = onprem_cs.encrypt(source_embedding)
    return encrypted_source_embedding

def cloud(encrypted_source_embedding):
    # restore the built cryptosystem in cloud with only public key
    cloud_cs = LightPHE(algorithm_name = "Paillier", precision = 19, key_file = "public.txt")

    # find l2 normalized and all positive vector embeddings - VGG-Face already does
    target_embedding = DeepFace.represent("target.jpg")[0]["embedding"]

    # find dot product of encrypted embedding and plain embedding
    encrypted_cosine_similarity = encrypted_source_embedding @ target_embedding

    # confirm that cloud cannot decrypt it even though it is calculated by cloud
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="must have private key"):
        cloud_cs.decrypt(encrypted_cosine_similarity)
    return encrypted_cosine_similarity

def verify(encrypted_cosine_similarity, threshold = 0.68):
    # restore the built cryptosystem on-prem with secret key
    onprem_cs = LightPHE(algorithm_name = "Paillier", precision = 19, key_file = "secret.txt")

    # restore cosine similarity
    cosine_similarity = onprem_cs.decrypt(encrypted_cosine_similarity)[0]
    print("same person" if cosine_similarity >= 1 - threshold else "different persons")
```

In this scheme, we leverage the computational power of the cloud to compute encrypted cosine similarity. However, the cloud has no knowledge of the actual calculations it performs. Only the secret key holder on the on-premises side can decrypt the encrypted cosine similarity and determine whether the pair represents the same person or different individuals.

Check out [`LightPHE`](https://github.com/serengil/LightPHE) library to find out more about partially homomorphic encryption.

Additionally, you can opt for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) instead of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE). However, FHE has certain limitations, including larger ciphertexts and keys, higher computational demands, and unsuitability for memory-constrained environments. Nevertheless, if you are determined to use FHE over PHE, you may consider exploring the [`CipherFace`](https://github.com/serengil/cipherface) library. It integrates DeepFace and TenSEAL, offering a simple interface for encrypting vector embeddings using FHE.

DeepFace wraps some external face recognition models: [VGG-Face](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/), [Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/LICENSE.md) (both 128d and 512d), [OpenFace](https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace/blob/master/LICENSE), [DeepFace](https://github.com/swghosh/DeepFace), [DeepID](https://github.com/Ruoyiran/DeepID/blob/master/LICENSE.md), [ArcFace](https://github.com/leondgarse/Keras_insightface/blob/master/LICENSE), [Dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt), [SFace](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/blob/master/models/face_recognition_sface/LICENSE), [GhostFaceNet](https://github.com/HamadYA/GhostFaceNets/blob/main/LICENSE) and
[Buffalo\_L](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/README.md). Besides, age, gender and race / ethnicity models were trained on the backbone of VGG-Face with transfer learning. Similarly, DeepFace wraps many face detectors: [OpenCv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/LICENSE), [Ssd](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/LICENSE), [Dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), [MtCnn](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn/blob/master/LICENSE), [Fast MtCnn](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch/blob/master/LICENSE.md), [RetinaFace](https://github.com/serengil/retinaface/blob/master/LICENSE), [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/LICENSE), [YuNet](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection/blob/master/LICENSE), [Yolo](https://github.com/derronqi/yolov8-face/blob/main/LICENSE) and [CenterFace](https://github.com/Star-Clouds/CenterFace/blob/master/LICENSE). Finally, DeepFace is optionally using [face anti spoofing](https://github.com/minivision-ai/Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing/blob/master/LICENSE) to determine the given images are real or fake. License types will be inherited when you intend to utilize those models. Please check the license types of those models for production purposes.
