Planner Analysis: Identity Verification Technology in Heirloom Platform
Based on the information I've gathered from the project, here's a comprehensive explanation of how the identity verification technology works in the Heirloom Identity Platform and the updates we've made:

Fundamental Technology Stack
The Heirloom Identity Platform uses facial recognition for identity verification through a multi-layered technology approach:

Frontend Technology:
React for web interfaces
React Native for mobile applications
Video capture components for recording verification videos
Backend Technology:
FastAPI Python framework
DeepFace library for facial recognition and comparison
FFmpeg (newly integrated) for video processing
Storage and Processing:
Local device storage for captured videos
Server-side storage for processed verification data
Database for user identity information
How Identity Verification Works
The identity verification flow operates as follows:

Video Capture:
User records a verification video through the web or mobile interface
Video is temporarily stored on the device
Video Processing:
The video is sent to the server
FFmpeg processes the video (replacing the previous Zencoder implementation)
Key frames are extracted for facial analysis
Facial Analysis:
DeepFace analyzes the extracted frames
Facial features are extracted and compared against reference images
Verification scores are calculated based on facial similarity
Verification Decision:
The system determines if the person in the video matches the registered identity
Results are returned to the user interface
Verification status is updated in the database
Key Updates We've Made
We've made several critical updates to improve the system:

FFmpeg Integration (Most Significant Update):
Replaced Zencoder with FFmpeg for video processing
Created an abstraction layer allowing either service to be used
Implemented video transcoding, frame extraction, and quality control
Added configurations for different video resolutions and qualities
Enhanced Backend Processing:
Updated to Python 3.10 for better performance
Improved DeepFace integration for more accurate facial recognition
Optimized video processing workflow for faster verification
Frontend Improvements:
Updated video verification hooks to work with the new backend
Ensured video playback components work with FFmpeg-processed videos
Working on quality selection options for controlling local storage impact
Mobile Optimizations:
Made components compatible with React Native
Implemented network-aware processing for different connection qualities
Created more efficient video compression for mobile devices
Testing and Validation:
Developed comprehensive test suites for the FFmpeg integration
Created performance benchmarks comparing FFmpeg with Zencoder
Implemented automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
