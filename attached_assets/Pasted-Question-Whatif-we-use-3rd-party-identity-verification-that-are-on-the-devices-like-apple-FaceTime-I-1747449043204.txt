Question:Whatif we use 3rd party identity verification that are on the devices like apple FaceTime ID and Googles version vs using deepfake or combination of it? How would you approach it?

Using Device-Native Biometric Authentication
Using device-native biometric verification like Apple's Face ID or Google's biometric systems would provide several advantages over your current custom implementation with DeepFace. Based on your codebase, I can suggest a hybrid approach that leverages both native biometrics and your existing system.

Benefits of Using Native Biometrics
Security: Native biometric systems have hardware-level security (secure enclave/TEE)
User Familiarity: Users already trust and understand these systems
Performance: Native implementations are highly optimized
Reduced Liability: You don't store biometric data directly
Implementation Approach
I'd recommend a hybrid approach:

Use native biometrics as the primary verification method
Fall back to your custom DeepFace implementation when native biometrics aren't available
Optionally use both for higher security scenarios
Here's how we could implement this in your codebase:

client/src/hooks/use-native-biometrics.tsx
client/src/components/biometric-verification.tsx
client/src/pages/settings.tsx
docs/NATIVE_BIOMETRICS.md
How This Approach Works
First Layer - Native Biometrics: Uses the device's built-in biometric system when available (Face ID, Touch ID, Android biometrics)
Second Layer - DeepFace: Falls back to your custom biometric verification when native systems aren't available
User Control: Settings allow users to choose their preferred verification method
Technical Implementation Details
This implementation:

Uses the Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) to interact with device biometrics
Detects available biometric methods automatically
Provides a smooth fallback to your existing implementation
Maintains the same UX flow and verification progress indicators
Security Advantages
Using native biometrics provides several security advantages:

Biometric data never leaves the device's secure hardware
Device-level anti-spoofing technology (depth sensors, etc.)
OS-level security validation of biometric verification
Reduced liability since you're not directly handling biometric data
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds - the security and user trust of native implementations with the flexibility of your custom solution when needed.
